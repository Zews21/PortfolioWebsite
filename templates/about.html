        <p class="text-center mt-4 lead">
            My journey in programming began as a hobby, sparked by a natural curiosity for how things work and a drive to create. Over time, this interest evolved into a deeper commitment to mastering software engineering. Alongside my own learning, I’ve found fulfillment in teaching younger students, where I strive to pass on what I've learned in a way that’s engaging and accessible. Looking ahead, I’m dedicated to making the most of my university years—building a strong foundation in computer science and exploring all the opportunities that will help me grow.
